    <h1>Push Swap</h1>
    <p>
      The project involves sorting a stack of integers using a restricted set of operations while striving for optimal performance.
      The goal of the Push_swap project is to write a program that sorts a stack of integers using only a limited set of operations.
      These operations must be applied to two stacks, often referred to as Stack A and Stack B. The final goal is to sort the numbers
      in ascending order in Stack A with the minimum number of operations.

    <ul>
      <li>To use <strong>Push_swap</strong>, start by cloning the repository: <code>git clone &lt;repository_url&gt;</code></li>
      <li>Navigate to the Push_swap folder: <code>cd push_swap</code></li>
      <li>Compile the program using: <code>make</code></li>
      <li>Run the program by typing: <code>./push_swap &lt;list_of_numbers&gt;</code></li>
      <li>To verify if it works correctly, use the checker program: <code>./push_swap 3 2 5 1 4 | ./checker 3 2 5 1 4</code></li>
    </ul>

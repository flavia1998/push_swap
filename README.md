<h1> Push Swap </h1>
 <p>The project involves sorting a stack of integers using a restricted set of operations while striving for optimal performance.
  The goal of the Push_swap project is to write a program that sorts a stack of integers using only a limited set of operations. 
    These operations must be applied to two stacks, often referred to as Stack A and Stack B.
    The final goal is to sort the numbers in ascending order in Stack A with the minimum number of operations.
